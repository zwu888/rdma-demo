# RDMA Demo (RoCE, ConnectX-4)

Two-node RDMA demo between:

| Host    | IP (RoCE link) | Device      |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| hpz8g4  | 192.168.100.1   | rocep21s0   |
| hpz6g4  | 192.168.100.2   | rocep45s0   |

Both hosts have a Mellanox ConnectX-4 connected by a direct QSFP28 cable
(no switch). The cards are single-port and were switched from native
InfiniBand to Ethernet mode (`LINK_TYPE_P1=ETH` via `mstconfig`) because
the cable wasn't recognized for native IB link training and there's no
Subnet Manager on this point-to-point link. RoCE (RDMA over Converged
Ethernet) avoids both issues.

## Prerequisites

Already installed on both hosts: `rdma-core`, `perftest`, `ibverbs-utils`,
`infiniband-diags`, `libfabric-bin`, `mstflint`.

## Usage

Run the server side first on one host, then the client side on the other,
passing the *server's* RoCE IP.

```bash
# on hpz6g4 (server)
scripts/run.sh server bw

# on hpz8g4 (client)
scripts/run.sh client bw 192.168.100.2
```

Test types: `bw` (bandwidth), `lat` (latency), `rate` (small-message rate).

## Reference results (2026-09-12, direct cable, 100Gb ConnectX-4)

- Bandwidth (64KB, RDMA Write): ~92.5 Gb/s
- Latency (2B, RDMA Write): ~0.94 us typical/average
- Message rate (2B, Send): ~3.6 Mpps
